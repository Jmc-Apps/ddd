Current build notes:
- Video Review controls are grouped by purpose.
- Prev and Next clip buttons were removed.
- The Reports shortcut button was removed from Video Stats Review.
- Angle cards now show Edit Videos instead of listing all clips.
- Edit Videos lets users add, remove and reorder clips for that angle.
- Batch clip export now warns that browsers may ask permission to allow multiple downloads.
- Same-day duplicate matches against the same opponent are numbered from 2 upward.
- Existing reports, resources, print-safe timelines and single README packaging are preserved.

Recommended use:
- Back up app data before replacing an installed copy.
- Refresh the browser or clear the PWA cache after updating if the old version remains visible.
- For reliable automatic video reload, use Chrome or an installed Chrome PWA and grant access to the selected Video Library Folder.
- Keep the external drive connected when opening a match. If Chrome requests access again, select Allow Video Access.
